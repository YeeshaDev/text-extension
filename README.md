# Text Dropper Chrome Extension

The Text Dropper Chrome extension allows users to inspect font properties and highlight selected text on web pages. It provides a convenient way to analyze the font details of any text element and easily highlight important information.

## Features

- **Text Inspection**: When hovering over a text element, the extension captures and displays various font properties, including font family, font size, font weight, line height, and color.
- **Font Family Detection**: The extension identifies the primary font family used, excluding generic font families like serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and fantasy. It also indicates if the font family is a Google Font.
- **Color Representation**: The extension converts the RGB color of the text to a hex format and displays it alongside a color palette.
